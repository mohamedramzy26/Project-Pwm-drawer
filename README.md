# PWM Signal Generator – Project_PWM_DRAWER

This project presents a simple and practical implementation for generating PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals using a microcontroller. The goal is to control devices such as motors or LEDs by adjusting the duty cycle of the signal.

## 📌 Objective

To design a flexible PWM output system that can be used for various control applications including motor speed regulation, LED brightness control, and signal modulation for embedded systems.

## 🔍 Overview

- Adjustable PWM frequency and duty cycle
- Real-time response to user input (e.g., via potentiometer or code)
- Clean and modular code structure for easy adaptation to other projects

## ⚙ Tools & Components Used

- Microcontroller (Arduino Uno or equivalent)
- Breadboard and jumper wires
- Optional: potentiometer, LED, small DC motor
- Power supply (5V)

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Understanding of timer-based PWM generation
- Signal shaping through code
- Hardware-level control for real-time applications

## 📂 File Structure

- main.ino: Arduino source code implementing PWM logic
- README.md: Project documentation and overview
